    <p>
      I would love to make some good websites for restaurants. <br>
      I really, really appreciate good food. 
      Some issues I've had that've prevented me from doing this: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          I want the website to be something I can just hand off to someone. 
        </li>
        <li>
          And I want to make an interface for the website that enables the restaurant owners 
          to easily update what they have on the website. Like, easier than wordpress even. 
          A person who can use an iphone to share a pic and comment on facebook should be able
          to update this website. 
        </li>
        <li>Obviously I don't know how to do number 2. But number 1 is also a problem.
          My one experience with making a website was on wordpress, and I'm still not 
          entirely sure how the ownership of the address, and how to get it, works. 
          How do I take html/css/js and just get it online? Idk. So i can't just hand it over
          to people and expect them to know what to do with it. 
        </li>
        <li>I'm also concerned about security issues. DIY would require an understanding of 
          what security measures need to be implemented, and I know nothing about that. 
        </li>
        <li>And obviously there are more reasons. Like, this is the 
          best I can do right now. Thankful for launchcode. 
        </li>
      </ol>
